# CoatRack Gateway (a.k.a. proxy)

This proxy:

* is to be installed by the service API provider
* needs network access to the service API that is to be made accessible 
* needs to be accessible via the Internet

The gateway-jar file is to be generated by running "coatrack/mvn package". 
Attempts to package the gateway locally in coatrack/spring-boot/proxy will
cause a classDefNotFoundException, since classes from coatrack/api are not 
considered.
